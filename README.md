# BILLOW.js

A collection of utility functions designed to make developing inside Upvise easier.

# Goals

1. Create a standard library of functions commonly needed when developing dashboards and form workflows in Upvise.
2. Improve reliability of our implementations by writing unit tests for these utilities.
3. Have more control over our addons by using our own functions rather than relying on Upvise.

**Note:** Due to the business wanting to move away from developing inside Upvise, we don't want to spend too much time on this project. However, this library can be developed alongside maintenance of existing works.
